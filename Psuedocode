Input: A positive integer n and a list of 2n disks of 
alternating colors light-dark starting with light

Output: A list of 2n disks, the first n disks are dark, 
the next n disks are light, and an integer m representing
the number of swaps to move the light ones after the dark ones.

def alternating_disk(n, S):
	count = 0
	var swapped
	var temp
	result = S
	for i in result
		swapped = false
		for j in result
			if S[j] > S[j + 1]
				temp = S[j]
				S[j] = S[j + 1]
				S[j + 1] = temp
				count++
				swapped = true
		if swapped == false
			break
	return S, count
