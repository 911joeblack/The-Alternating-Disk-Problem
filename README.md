### How to run 
##### 1. (Easy Way) Run From Visual Studio
Copy and paste the code from Source.cpp into a C++ project and press the run button

##### 2. From Terminal/VSCode
Ensure you have a C++ Compiler installed on your machine, in this case we will use the g++ compiler
Using git, clone the repository locally to your machine, or optionally copy and paste into a file named Source.cpp
If you have VSCode an the C/C++ extension installed, you can then open the project and press the run button.

Or, you can run the project from the terminal by first setting your directory to whatever folder contains the project, you may then compile using g++ -g Source.cpp -o [AnyNameYouWant].exe
You can then run the code typing [AnyNameYouWant] into the terminal, it will then execute the program.
